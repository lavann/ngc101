In this session we will create the UI that will talk to the API, that we created in an earlier session (session 2)

From the command line, use the ng cli to create our project with the following command

ng new books-ui
![cli](./images/cli.png)

NG cli will request user prompts for the following:
![angular-routing](./images/angularRouting.png)

Y - Angular Routing
![angular-routing](./images/yesRouting.png)

Select CSS for style sheet
![CSS](./images/css.png)

cli will install all relevant dependencies
![depend](./images/dependancy.png)

Navigate to the folder that has been created by the cli
![nav](./images/navConsole.png)

Launch VS Code - Code .
![launchCode](./images/launchCode.png)

Invoke the CLI to serve the application
![ng1](./images/ngServe1.png)

![ng2](./images/ngServe2.png)

Launch the browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200, you will be presented with the application that the CLI has created.
![browser](./images/browser.png)

Within VS Code, locate app.component.html
SRC => APP => app.component.html
![VS Code App Component](./images/vscode_app_component1.png)

Select all of the content within the file CTRL + A, and then delete.
